0
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,660
We want to create autonomous vehicles that are intelligent enough

1
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:10,520
to drive us around.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,160
We don't see autonomy as a binary value:

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,940
either you have it, or not, but as a continuum of capabilities

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,980
that vehicles might possess.

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,710
I will present a generally accepted classification

6
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:24,170
called the "levels of automation", from Level 0

7
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:27,660
to level 5, which means completely autonomous.

8
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,820
Because it was created by automotive engineers,

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,560
they used the word "automation",

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,960
but roboticists like to use the word "autonomy" here.

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,500
This graphic shows the description of the levels of autonomy.

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,300
Let's start with Level 5.

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:43,120
Level 5 corresponds to a completely autonomous car.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,370
These cars don't exist today.

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,390
A level 5 car is a car that you can call and will show up at your door.

16
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,330
It will ask you where you want to go, and it will get you there

17
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,000
while you relax and play Sudoku in the back.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,040
Think of a taxi, but without a taxi driver,

19
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,220
and completely missing the pedals or the steering wheel.

20
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,280
Let's get back to Earth and see what exists today.

21
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,030
In Level 0 cars the human fully controls the car,

22
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,230
in the sense of steering and acceleration at all normal times.

23
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:14,950
There can still be some electronic mediation between the user's commands

24
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,980
and the car's actuators in case of emergency.

25
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:22,390
Since the 90s, there have been electronic systems such as ABS  (anti-lock braking

26
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,230
system) and ESC (electronic stability control)

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,420
as well as many other variations on those ideas.

28
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,750
You have felt them if you have ever driven on a wet surface,

29
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:38,070
on snow and ice, and something happened, and you slammed on the brakes,

30
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,090
and heard some weird vibrations, and eventually you came to a safe stop.

31
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:44,550
Without assistance, the car would have spun out of control.

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,060
More recently, Level 0 features include the generation of safety warnings,

33
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,670
such as a parking warning or a lane departure warning.

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,850
These features require the system to be aware of the environment,

35
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,700
so they need cameras or distance sensors.

36
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,790
However, the system does not act.

37
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:05,730
The warning tells the driver that something is concerning

38
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,060
and it is the driver that must rectify the situation.

39
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,630
In Level 1 cars, the human shares control of the vehicle.

40
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:16,600
The human is required to maintain eyes on the road and hands

41
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,080
on the steering wheel, but some control is automated.

42
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,440
An example is a feature like automatic cruise control, which

43
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,610
keeps the velocity constant or the distance to the next vehicle constant,

44
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,860
while the human controls the steering.

45
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,590
These systems can reduce driver fatigue in traffic

46
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,180
along stretches of highway.

47
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,520
Another example is a parking assistance system

48
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,030
in which the car steers, but the human controls the speed of the vehicle.

49
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:45,870
In Level 2 cars, the machine can take full control of the vehicle

50
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,420
for both steering and acceleration.

51
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,710
These cars already exist.

52
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,220
Level 2 cars can drive along a lane by themselves.

53
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,240
They may still require confirmation from the user in some cases, for example

54
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,640
when to initiate a lane change.

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,300
At Level 2 there are two "drivers", a human driver and a machine driver,

56
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,500
and they alternate.

57
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,490
The human must be alert and ready to take back control at any time.

58
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:15,540
In Level 3 cars, the human would be supposedly allowed to direct attention

59
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,420
away from the driving task.

60
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,980
In a Level 3 car you will be able to watch a movie on your phone,

61
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,340
but you still have to sit-in the driver's seat

62
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,910
and be ready to take over when the system requires you to do it.

63
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,860
Whether safe Level 3 systems are possible is still an open question.

64
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,238
The problem here is that, presumably, when

65
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:36,030
the car would ask you to take back control,

66
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,680
you would have to react very quickly.

67
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,230
And you can imagine it would take you a few seconds just

68
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,900
to stop watching the movie, and try to get your bearings,

69
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,470
and assess the situation.

70
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,900
Level 3 seemed a good idea at the beginning.

71
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,560
It seemed a small, feasible, incremental step from Level 2.

72
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,400
However, people have realized that it may

73
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,400
be more difficult to create Level to 2 than the higher levels of autonomy.

74
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,140
In levels 4 and 5, the car is completely autonomous.

75
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,690
There's only one driver, which is the machine.

76
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:08,500
You sit in the back and the car gets to the destination.

77
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,130
The difference between level 4 and 5 is just the scope.

78
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,430
Level 5 means that the car can operate anywhere, on any road,

79
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,800
on any condition.

80
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,220
So the steering wheel is completely useless.

81
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:26,810
Level 4 means that the car is able to be autonomous in only in a smaller operating domain.

82
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,630
Level 4 is feasible, depending on the scope.

83
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,500
An autonomous taxi company can choose where and when to operate.

84
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,440
It can choose to deploy in sunny weather rather than in  snowy weather.

85
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,610
There are already several examples of companies deploying an autonomous taxi

86
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,350
service in limited areas.

87
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,440
It is now a question of progressively enlarging the scope.

88
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,030
Level 5 is the North Star for the field.

89
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,000
It gives us the direction, although we may never reach it.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,210
As of today, Level 5 autonomy does not appear

91
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,903
to be inconceivable, although it is hard to speculate on a timeline.

92
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:03,570
The more we understand about these problems, the more optimistic

93
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:06,150
we are about getting there eventually.

94
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:09,930
But the timeline seems to expand as we learn of the genuine challenges

95
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,400
that we need to solve.

96
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,630
To summarize, we have seen the definition of the levels of autonomy.

97
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,750
Although they are numbered 0 to 5, and in the past

98
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:25,630
we went incrementally from 0 to 1 to 2, there is a discontinuity at Level 3.

99
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,350
Most of the industry players are starting directly at Level 4,

100
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,590
skipping Level 3.

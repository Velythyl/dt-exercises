00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,410
There are two words that you often find in the discussions

1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,580
about self-driving cars: "autonomous" and "automated".

2
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,329
These words have different meanings depending on who uses them;

3
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:18,310
and the meanings change with time.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:20,450
Sometimes they're used interchangeably;

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:23,600
however, they do imply something slightly different.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,210
Let's look at the etymology.

7
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,660
The word "automation" comes from the Greek "automaton", which

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,090
meant something that acts by itself.

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,520
People called automata those mechanical devices

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,075
that could recreate complex motions that were mechanically stored.

11
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:40,840
There are examples of such devices created millennia ago,

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,550
but I will give you a more recent example.

13
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,930
100 years ago automatic pianos, or "pianolas",

14
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:48,730
were something common in the West.

15
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,930
The music was encoded in perforated papers that would be read mechanically.

16
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:56,890
Each hole corresponded to a key that would be pressed.

17
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:01,180
Eventually, the word "automated" was used to describe manufacturing machines that

18
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,810
would always repeat the same motion.

19
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,460
This word has a very industrial flavor to it.

20
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,680
The other word, "autonomous", means literally something

21
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,640
that has its own laws, in the sense that it is self-governing.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,760
This suggests something that does not follow predefined steps,

23
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,700
but, rather, it has some internal laws or principles or goals

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,480
that it must achieve.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,550
The actions that are chosen are those that achieve

26
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,650
the goals given the current scenario.

27
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,667
In the field of robotics, we talk about "autonomous robots".

28
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,750
It's actually to make the distinction with respect

29
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,470
to the previous generation of machines.

30
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,380
Another word we use is "embodied autonomy",

31
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,710
which clarifies that the systems we're interested in

32
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,240
are those that have a body.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,860
They are em-bodied.

34
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,830
These are systems that interact with the real world, as opposed

35
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,150
to a virtual world.

36
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,360
What does "robot" mean?

37
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,520
Robot comes from the Czech word robota, which means forced labor.

38
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,767
Robots are machines that work for us.

39
00:01:57,767 --> 00:01:59,600
I would not say they're "forced", because they

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
don't have any choice, or the ability to choose,

41
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,360
or the consciousness to understand their place in the world.

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,940
The way that robotics contributes to society

43
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:11,450
is by creating machines that can do the dull, dirty, and dangerous work

44
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:14,160
that humans should not do.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,470
When we say robot, classically we mean both

46
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,470
fixed machines like industrial manipulators, as well

47
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:22,590
as those robots that move in an environment, like a vacuum cleaner,

48
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,920
a drone, or the micro-robots that one day will be in your guts fixing you up.

49
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
For moving robots, we use the word "vehicle", which comes from Latin.

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,230
A vehicle is something that moves and carries

51
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:36,660
something else, like people or cargo.

52
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,160
When regular people say "autonomous vehicles" they mean "self-driving cars".

53
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,250
However, for the roboticist, also a drone and a vacuum cleaner,

54
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:46,290
are autonomous vehicles.

55
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,350
The reality is that the concepts we're going to talk about in this course

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:52,990
can be applied to any autonomous vehicle, not just cars.

57
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:55,930
I presented to you the consistent nomenclature that we will follow.

58
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,770
We defined automation, autonomy, robot, and vehicle.

59
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,690
There are other words that we need to define,

60
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,380
such as intelligence and intelligent, but this merits a longer discussion.

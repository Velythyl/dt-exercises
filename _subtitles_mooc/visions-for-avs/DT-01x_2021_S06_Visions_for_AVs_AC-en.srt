00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:08,960
In the previous videos, I introduced the concept of autonomous vehicles

1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,540
and the "levels of autonomy" classification.

2
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:14,420
In this video, I will tell you about the history of the field,

3
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:16,790
and how the vision for the use cases has evolved

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,340
during the years, and some economic considerations.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,970
The study of autonomous vehicles in the sense of cars is relatively recent.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,440
The earliest example was from 1986, when a German researcher, Professor

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,409
Dickmanns, demonstrated highway driving based on vision.

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,520
His experiments demonstrated that real-time control of heavy vehicles

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,790
was possible.

10
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,645
However, it was difficult to engineer reliable solutions because

11
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:42,060
of the technology available at the time.

12
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,890
The turning point for the field came around 2003.

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,640
A catalyst was a series of Grand Challenges created

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,810
by DARPA, The Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US military,

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:54,930
between 2004 and 2007.

16
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,390
The US military had been funding several projects

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,220
before to create autonomous land vehicles, at the point where

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,239
they already developed autonomous drones and other flying vehicles.

19
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,000
The first vision for AVs was the military vision.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,310
In general, we said that robots should do the "3D" jobs, where

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,440
the three Ds stand for the qualities of the jobs that humans don't want to do--

22
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,330
dull, dangerous, and dirty.

23
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,950
And the military application is dull, dangerous, and dirty.

24
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,380
The DARPA challenges came at an opportune time,

25
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,140
in which exciting developments in various fields of science

26
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,650
and technology created conditions to make the goal look feasible.

27
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,750
For example, sensing technology like LiDAR

28
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:34,480
had improved accuracy and affordability.

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,260
That provided a way for vehicles to easily sense the world around them.

30
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,480
Important developments in probabilistic robotics

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,920
made AVs able to localize in an environment

32
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,555
and track the other vehicles.

33
00:01:44,555 --> 00:01:46,930
Moreover, the increased computation available at the time

34
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:51,380
made it possible to run those algorithms in real time.

35
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,380
The first DARPA Challenge was a disaster,

36
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,080
in the sense that nobody arrived at this finish line.

37
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,620
However, people realized that autonomous vehicles for civilian application

38
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,100
would be feasible with just a bit more development.

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,980
Many of the first challenges participants

40
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,389
went on to found the companies that work in self-driving cars now.

41
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:12,870
The second vision was now the vision of the personal chauffeur.

42
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,890
Forget the military applications and the driving in some faraway desert,

43
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:20,380
we can make cars on our roads drive by themselves.

44
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,590
As discussed in previous videos, this is at the Level 5 vision--

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,510
a car that can drive anywhere.

46
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,120
People realized quickly that this is a very ambitious goal

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,540
from a technical point of view, and also the economics may not work out.

48
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,700
The competing vision for AVs is that of "mobility as a service".

49
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,000
Ridesharing services like Uber, created in 2010,

50
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,040
showed a different way to think about personal mobility.

51
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,220
If you need a car, you can call one, get on, get off with minimal friction.

52
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,800
Of course, there were taxis before, but they filled

53
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,110
a different niche, the business niche.

54
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,280
In many places, prices were kept high by artificially limiting the supply

55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,540
by limiting number of taxi permits.

56
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,920
Uber showed that single cars could act as a form of public transportation.

57
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,160
You don't own the car, just like you don't own the buses or trains

58
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,110
or subway cars.

59
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,310
Now, it is unclear whether the economics of ridesharing services is sustainable.

60
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,950
Companies like Uber have been losing money for years

61
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,480
because they subsidize the rides to gain market share.

62
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,670
There's also some regulatory uncertainty.

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,860
In some parts of the world, governments have

64
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,765
challenged the business model of making drivers contractors

65
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:31,140
rather than employees, which allows the companies to have

66
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,150
relatively large margins.

67
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,980
Everybody's been enjoying artificially cheap rides.

68
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,390
In any case, ridesharing services are a great complement to public transport.

69
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:43,660
People realized that AVs could be the technology that

70
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:45,920
will make the field extremely profitable by removing

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,310
the extra cost for the driver.

72
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:51,340
It's interesting to compare the vision of Level 5 chauffeurs

73
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,950
to the vision of autonomous mobility on demand.

74
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,030
There are two aspects to understand, technology and economics.

75
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,720
For Level 5 cars, we need to quantify the value of autonomy for the customer.

76
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,210
Tesla has done the market research for us.

77
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:08,570
Tesla has been selling the option to have the car that you buy today

78
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,480
to be "fully self-driving" in the future.

79
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,980
That option cost $10,000 today.

80
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,760
Now, of course, today, the customer buys only a promise.

81
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,820
If the functionality were already there, people would pay more.

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,850
Let's double the figure and say that autonomy for a personal car

83
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,090
would be worth $20,000 on average to the customer.

84
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:28,830
Say that the car lasts a minimum of 10 years.

85
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:31,960
The value of autonomy is $2,000 per year.

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,630
Now let's look at the economics of taxi services.

87
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:37,470
There are many studies to discuss the price structure.

88
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,710
The major cost is not the car itself, it's not the fuel or maintenance,

89
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,360
but it's the driver's wages.

90
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,740
In the US, the average taxi driver makes $36,000 per year.

91
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,790
If autonomy can get rid of the driver, the value would be $36,000 per year.

92
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:54,820
This simple calculation shows that autonomous mobility on demand

93
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:57,850
is much more feasible economically, because the budget you

94
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,465
have to build a system with is almost 20 times larger than for the Level 5 vision.

95
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:06,090
From the technical perspective, autonomous mobility on demand

96
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,090
only requires Level 4 capabilities, because the operator

97
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:12,660
can choose where and when to deploy the taxi service.

98
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,640
There are also more efficiencies to be gained

99
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,300
when considering a company that operates a large fleet of self-driving cars used

100
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,880
as taxis.

101
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,060
The cars will be cheaper to build and more comfortable.

102
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,580
They might look more like living rooms on wheels

103
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:28,590
than the sedans currently used for taxes.

104
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:31,320
It is cheaper to build and maintain a fleet of cars

105
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,130
with high usage and turnover, perhaps being recycled every two years,

106
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,430
than having many personal cars that must last at least 10 years.

107
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,290
There's a high cost in supporting 10-years-old autonomy features.

108
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:46,050
We talked about mobility on demand for people.

109
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,760
The same applies to cargo.

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,360
In places like the US, most land-based goods transportation

111
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,010
is realized using trucks.

112
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:55,590
Autonomous trucks are an even better possible deployment

113
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,270
target for autonomy.

114
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,780
They need to work only on highways, which is a very structured environment, in which

115
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,750
is easier to drive than in urban environments.

116
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:09,040
In summary, in this video, we talked about the recent history of AVs,

117
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,120
and we discussed how the vision changed from military use to personal chauffeur

118
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,690
to autonomous mobility on demand.

00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,640
Hi, my name is Frank.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,000
And in this video,
we're going to take a look

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,520
at Duckietown DP twenty one Molk Robot
in here, you will see,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,880
is a box from Duckietown that contains
all the parts necessary for the robot.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:19,000
Let's take a look at what's inside.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,840
So opening the box,

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:29,040
removing the protection from you'll see
your Jetson nanotube gigabit version

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,520
set aside.
You'll have your two ducks.

9
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,240
Obviously,

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,080
you'll have your wheels.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,720
These are your two wheels.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,440
You will have your motor
with the encoder assembly here.

13
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,560
You also have a micro SD card reader.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,800
And inside here, under the SD protection

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,040
back, you have one of them
is the back plate.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,720
So this goes to back off the robot

17
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,640
and then this is your motor driver

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,560
controller and you connect
all your accessories

19
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,000
like sensors onto this
board instead of the Jetson

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,440
in this bag, you have your fan
as well as your power switch.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:21,120
You also have the blue part
is your camera Mount Holder.

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,960
And we also have a USB
to micro USB connector.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:31,200
And inside this white box
is your camera module.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,040
We'll take a look.

25
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,640
You'll see here it is your camera with
the short ribbon attached to it already

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,320
inside here.
Oops.

27
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,640
So this is your micro SD card

28
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,680
and this is your Wi-Fi adapter dongle

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,680
in here.
You will see the cables that you need

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,520
to build your Duckiebot
as well at a Internet cable.

31
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:09,720
You will also have the dot matrix
for your back of your robot for

32
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
telling the other robot where Duckiebot is
as well as you also have some stickers.

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,360
You have a screwdriver

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,120
in here.

35
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:26,840
You have a this is your front connect
the front front light this large pieces,

36
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,200
your front light and then
the other two included.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,480
One is the image sensor.

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,520
And then you also have a display module.

39
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,840
This is your display module,
you can see a little screen over there.

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,280
This is your only display

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,800
and

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,320
it's a bit hard to take it out

43
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:56,080
inside here you can see
your Duckiebot battery.

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,960
You have all sorts of screws in here,

45
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,480
and then this is basically
the old white back wheel

46
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,600
underneath the chassis,
don't throw the box away yet.

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:15,800
Underneath you will
find these blue pieces.

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,240
That's your main robot chassis.

49
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,440
So don't panic if you don't find your
robot chassis parts.

50
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,120
OK, let's build this robot.

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,600
Then before we build anything,
we're going to take apart and piece out

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,160
the plastic piece we need
for building our DP.

53
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,240
Twenty one local robot

54
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,360
to open them up.

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,240
And as you can see, all the pieces
are actually on there already.

56
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
The only thing we will
need is to pop them off.

57
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,560
So these are already cut.

58
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,280
So I need to do is just very carefully
break off all the parts you will need.

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,440
And that's the first port and then
the second word contains the larger part,

60
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,760
where one of them is going to be the top

61
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,720
of the car and the one of them
is going to be part of your car.

62
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,760
And you also have some
bumper pieces over there.

63
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,240
These are your motor holder pieces.

64
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,920
We'll go through them later one by one
after you have broken up all the pieces.

65
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
Now you're ready to actually
build your robot.

66
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,440
First, we're going to install
the drive unit and install the motors.

67
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,760
Now, before you start,

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,760
another thing to note is that there are
protective film on these.

69
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
All the plastic pieces that you just broke

70
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,000
up where you can do is you can
just easily peel them off.

71
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,240
And you will have a relatively shiny bald

72
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,800
first, we're going
to install our drive base

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:07,200
to do that first grab two piece of metal
nut and then insert into those two grooves

74
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:07,840
next.

75
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,680
You want to be very careful how you
hold this board as if you did it wrong.

76
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,600
You will have you will have
trouble installing your OMU unit,

77
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:24,600
make sure these two screw holes is facing
you while this triangular bit is facing

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,560
forward that will ensure
you're holding it upside down.

79
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,400
Right.

80
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,080
If you flip it, you will have trouble
later installing your Ayumu unit

81
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,640
to install your motor,
grab these two pieces,

82
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,640
insert like this,

83
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,160
and then these will hold your motor,

84
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,760
make sure your motors
wire connection faces inward

85
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,920
like this.

86
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,280
These will be where you
attach your wheels later.

87
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,520
Next, we want to align the holes
and then putting these long screws in.

88
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,800
These are the longest screw
offered in the package.

89
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,680
Next, we want to connect the cables before

90
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,480
you put Pollsmoor in, there will be
a very painful process to do that.

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,600
Notice that one of the connectors are
larger, one of the connectors are smaller.

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,720
The larger one goes to the motor itself.

93
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,600
There's also groups on it.

94
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,120
So make sure you don't force
the connectors as they're pretty fragile.

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,200
You want to make sure you
align them correctly.

96
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,920
And it should be very easy to presetting

97
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,280
once you have the cables.

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,800
There's the cable management.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,120
So right there, you want to insert
your cables through that.

100
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,720
Be careful very gently.

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,040
You don't want to break that little piece.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,000
And that's one part of the motor.

103
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,120
And then you just do
it for the other side.

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,200
It might also be a good idea
to plug in the cables first.

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,480
Next, we're going to install the EMU,

106
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,840
the EMU is the board with two holes,

107
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:33,080
a connector and a bunch of
pink connectors.

108
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,320
You want to grab the longer cable.

109
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,280
Make sure when you plug in these cables,
be very gentle as there is a direction

110
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,200
and you don't want to bend the paint
grab to nylon screws and two nylon knots.

111
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,960
Where you want to do is you want to insert
your AMMU right there like this.

112
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,760
They should be perfectly aligned.

113
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,240
So if you flip the board time,
you will not stay.

114
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,800
Next, you want to

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,160
rulz this wire up through there.

116
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,600
We want to do is you want to screw

117
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,160
from the reverse side
and then have the nuts through there.

118
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,080
Make sure that you are using the nylon

119
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,320
screws,
since they are electronic components

120
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,400
on the board and you don't want
to use metal parts to short them.

121
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:32,560
Just like that, next, we want to install
our pactio assembly to do that,

122
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:37,600
still have the motor facing towards you,

123
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,600
and then we are going to do
is with these two screws.

124
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,240
They're going to start to stand off.

125
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Like, so I recommend you read
the cables outside the stand off.

126
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,160
Then that will mount your motor,
need another two sets of screws.

127
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,080
Now you have complete
your bottom drive unit.

128
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,880
Next, we're going to install our battery,
hold our power to do this.

129
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
We need a battery and these four pieces

130
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,800
from the plastic, we have also notes
that there are plastic protection films.

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,680
Don't forget to peel them out
while you put this together.

132
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,880
Make sure these two school halls
are like shown in the image

133
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,760
not upside down, as you will
have trouble installing later.

134
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:46,640
So make sure
your left hand side should have a screw

135
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,480
that's closer to the edge and your right
hand side should have a screw that's

136
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,800
farther to the edge and your
pointing front to do that.

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,160
First you want to insert a few nuts.

138
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,480
These are going to be helpful for later
when you connect other parts of the robot.

139
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,200
Basically, if you see a shape like this,
there should be a nut inside of it.

140
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,880
Those are for holding the nuts
still while you're squirting.

141
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,760
Next, we want to preplanned some
of the schools in the board,

142
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:25,960
these will be very helpful
when we start our Jetson's panels,

143
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,720
so just make sure these are
all in those four holes.

144
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:35,920
As shown and then you want to do is
you want to flip it upside down.

145
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,000
You want to basically put some nylon,
not to hold them in place.

146
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,520
Just like that now you
want to flip it over.

147
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,360
Next, we're going to start
installing the size again.

148
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,160
Make sure you have a.

149
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,680
Basically, you have a knot in all of these

150
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,520
shaped grooves where these are holding
the knot, if you're having trouble putting

151
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,440
these together,
what the goal is, is the flat side.

152
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,440
So it's a hexagon shape, right?

153
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,360
The half of the flat side should sitting
just like that.

154
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,280
Next, we're going to put
this assembly together.

155
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,440
So where you want to do is, as you
can see, there are some notches and

156
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,200
little notches all over.

157
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:31,240
We want to do is you want to align them.

158
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,240
And what you should have is they
will just perfectly fitting

159
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,720
just like that, and you will
have the longer part towards you

160
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,280
next.

161
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,480
Where you want to do is you want
to grab two smaller size metal screw,

162
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,840
flip this upside down very carefully
without dropping ending up.

163
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,880
And then you can see the amazing
assembly pulling together right there.

164
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,040
And all of them should fit perfectly.

165
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
Just like that.

166
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,120
Next, we're going to just
grab these two pieces.

167
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,920
And then those two are going to be
the battery stopper,

168
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:35,040
so make sure your battery is actually
upside down when sliding right in there.

169
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,560
And also where you can see is
this little hole will be the way of you

170
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,320
accessing the battery
then will you want to do is just simply

171
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,000
insert these tubes

172
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
right there

173
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,560
and your battery shouldn't
move around anymore.

174
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,200
Next, we're going to have the exciting

175
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:59,600
part of putting the top the battery part,
as well as the drive part together.

176
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,440
So to do that, you simply

177
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,480
put it on there

178
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,640
and then we want to do it very carefully.

179
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,080
Also router cables through.

180
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,040
So the immutable goes through the front

181
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:19,960
big hole and then the two drivetrain cable
or the motor cable

182
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,560
goes on the back just like that.

183
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,960
Then you want to put the screws
to basically secure them together.

184
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:33,760
There should be four schools
in total that you want to put it.

185
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,120
And now your top part and the bottom
part are connected together.

186
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,320
Next, you want to do is
install your motors.

187
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:55,200
We want to grab these two
white little spacers,

188
00:13:55,400 --> 00:14:00,640
then your wheels should
go right like that.

189
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,200
And now your Duckiebot DP twenty
one most resembles a car.

190
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:09,200
Next, we're at the exact moment of

191
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,600
opening the Jets and that'll

192
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,920
be very careful if you're
doing this in the winter.

193
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:21,480
Watch out for static chargers.

194
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,520
Widgets and Nano should sit
on your Duckiebot like this.

195
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,120
Next, we're going to install our
Jessan Nano.

196
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,400
I'll cover there's basically two parts.

197
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,600
As you can see,
they resemble a somewhat different shape.

198
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,080
What's that?
This part have a little loose piece on it

199
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:49,960
that basically helps you to cover
your Jetson 2G version when you put

200
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,040
together the sidepiece notes that you
might have to let go Jetson Nano a little

201
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:00,840
bit for the sidepiece to sit
perfectly and huggin the Jetson Nano

202
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,400
once you have a line down.

203
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
Skouris Grusin.

204
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:10,080
Not that there is another little piece
that if you accidentally pop it off like

205
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,840
me, you can just stick it back in,
that basically it was for the two

206
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,360
different jets and nanobots,
again, for the other side.

207
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,960
Same story.

208
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,600
Make sure they align perfectly.

209
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,200
Once you have make sure you adjust

210
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,280
and then I'll sit tight in the robot,
you can then put out your nylon screws

211
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,400
to make sure the detonator
doesn't move to drive.

212
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,200
Once you have installed your two I o plate

213
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,720
and the two side plates will you want
to do is you want to grab these little

214
00:15:54,920 --> 00:16:00,000
spacers and then just pop
it right onto the screws.

215
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:13,680
Next, why you want to do is you want
to grab the spacers, you need two of them

216
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:17,160
double connect it like this.

217
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:25,840
And then two of them at just the regular
size, and then you want to screw them

218
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:32,440
onto the screws,
so the two long one goes in the front.

219
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:38,080
And the two short ones grossing about.

220
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,520
Next, you want to connect the battery
cables for the battery cables.

221
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,640
You'll have a total
of three battery cables,

222
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:54,200
you will have one with two and

223
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,680
then two regular cables.

224
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,920
So first, we want to do is want
to connect this to end of the cables

225
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,720
on the bottom USB swap,

226
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,560
then right into

227
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,600
the battery pack.

228
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,120
It should fit very neatly

229
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,120
at the correct Linus

230
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,840
for your middle cable,

231
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,280
where you want to do
is you want to root it.

232
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,680
Thorough

233
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,120
and then plug it upside down.

234
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,800
Just like that,

235
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,960
and then for your other
cable where you want to do

236
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,640
is you want to plug it in.

237
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,560
And then rode it all the way to.

238
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,920
Just like that, next,
we're going to plug in our Wi-Fi card,

239
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,240
Wi-Fi card goes to the top, you the USB
slot that's next to the HDMI cable.

240
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,720
Next, we're going to install
our back bumper assembly.

241
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,720
First, plugging the cable in for this one.

242
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,360
We're going to use a short cable.

243
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:32,400
Your back bumper should have the little
triangular trapezoidal tip on top.

244
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,680
When you connect them,

245
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:41,960
make sure your router cable through the
hole where the motor is routed to.

246
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,520
Should look like that

247
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,200
then you're just going
to screw this grusin.

248
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,960
Next, we're going to install
the controller,

249
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,800
the controller board holder,
so to install that, it's very simple.

250
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,760
It's just two screws.

251
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,400
So the controller is
going to go at the back

252
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,000
end.

253
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,400
Where we want to do is
to screws and then screw.

254
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,280
Uncontrollable should be standing up

255
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,920
a little bit behind
the regular display board.

256
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,800
Next, we're going to install the fan

257
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,720
assembly to install the fan
and just put it right there.

258
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,920
And then you should use
the longer of the four screws.

259
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,680
We can also do is you can pre table

260
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:44,240
management a little bit since we don't
meet that much of a fan table outside.

261
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,080
Next, we're going to grab our control

262
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:57,720
board and start installing the wires first
you want to install your friend header,

263
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,400
the fan header should be plugged onto

264
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,200
the microcontroller boards pings as
illustrated in the picture next to work.

265
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,120
And why are these motor cables?

266
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:14,960
So to do so we want to do is you want
to use this thought as your guide

267
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,760
or McKibbon management site

268
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,960
and then you will be able to

269
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,000
just like that.

270
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,280
Slide them writing, as well as

271
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,200
allowing them
onto the Jets Nanos ping header.

272
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,640
And then make sure you remember

273
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,960
which cable is which, if not,
then you can just

274
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,880
yank it a little bit and then you
can tell which one is from which.

275
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,560
Make sure your router allied cable towards

276
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,760
the right hand side as the LCD connector
would go to this one

277
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,680
might be a little bit of a stretch.

278
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,200
Just be very careful

279
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,200
not to break any connectors.

280
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,040
Just like that,

281
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,680
you do seem to connect your motor cable,

282
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,560
make sure so your right one goes
on to the top of the two slot.

283
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,800
That and your bottom line
goes to the left, Malter.

284
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,720
And just like that, and you can tuck away

285
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,320
slacks a little bit inside next,
you want to connect?

286
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,400
I am cable

287
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,040
to your connector.

288
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,840
That's in the middle

289
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,560
right there.

290
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,840
Just want to plug it in.

291
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,320
Going to be very gentle,
you don't want to break the board,

292
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,640
and that's who I am you going

293
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,640
next to, we're going to install
the camera assembly.

294
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,320
So first we're going to put our camera,

295
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,200
the ribbon cable through.

296
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,000
Like that

297
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,720
camera should have these four
little notches facing the camera

298
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,520
like that.

299
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,400
And then you want to insert.

300
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,400
The four smaller,
smaller sized nylon screws.

301
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,480
Just like that.

302
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,560
You want to installed the nuts,

303
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,680
the four extremely things,
small nylon nuts at the back.

304
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:49,240
Next, we want to do is we want to connect
this metal piece

305
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,200
or the connector piece actually
to the camera assembly, to do that

306
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,760
we want to do is see there's a little slot

307
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,480
right there and it should align
perfectly with the slope right there.

308
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,440
We want to do is for one side,
grab a middle school

309
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,240
pocket through.

310
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,920
And then connect on that at the end.

311
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,440
And then for the other end,
we want to do is there's a single plastic

312
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,000
piece standoff we want to do is
you want to grab a metal screw

313
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,960
and then

314
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,760
poke it right through
from the back to the front.

315
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,760
So that you can screw
this plastic piece on.

316
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:49,880
Just like that, I have one facing
front and one school facing downward.

317
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,680
Next, we want to do is you want
to grab another connector cable

318
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,400
and then we want to do is you want to flip

319
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,520
to the back and then
plug in to this point.

320
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,640
Like that,

321
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,320
additionally, you want to put another

322
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,480
cable on top right corner or
top left corner excuse me,

323
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,680
and you want to insert it right there

324
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,560
just like that,

325
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,920
then we're going to meet
these two piece together

326
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,240
going around the cable through
just like how we related to Rimu.

327
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,000
And then pull it through all the way.

328
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,040
Just like that,

329
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:41,160
and then these are going to be connecting

330
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,800
towards the middle one, the first one

331
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,120
we also wanted to tell.

332
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,960
So this is the one that connects

333
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:54,040
to the middle piece, this one
to be connecting to the back

334
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,360
of the three ports over there.

335
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,840
Right there.

336
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,560
And this one is going to connect.

337
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,560
To this point,

338
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,280
which is in the middle of the bottom three
right there.

339
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:21,240
So this one should be empty and then this
one goes to the top, her top part

340
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:27,600
of the front bumper already
and then the middle cable after

341
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,280
from bumper LCD shirttail
to the latter of these three.

342
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:37,440
Next, we're going to just
install this onto their.

343
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,240
SO to do that, we're just going
to grab some screws and a security.

344
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,680
Once we have put the front bumper

345
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,880
assembly, we're going to attach
a camera ribbon cable.

346
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,520
Make sure your metal part
is facing the right way.

347
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,240
It's always a good rule of thumb
that the metal part should be facing

348
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,720
the trace side
and then the plastic side should have

349
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,880
to prove I should have the blue side
facing from the camera ribbon cable

350
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,960
next to work and to install the distance
sensor module on the stand off.

351
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,160
That's standing up.

352
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,040
So the camera in the distance
module is a little piece.

353
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,680
We want to do is you just want to

354
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,000
attach it right there,
want to do is just attach it right there

355
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,320
and then scream your nylon that.

356
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,160
Next, we want to connect this assembly

357
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:52,800
to the plate where you want to do is
grab the extremely short piece of cable

358
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,280
and then plug it in from the bottom.

359
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,240
Just be again, be very
careful with the connector.

360
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:07,240
Like that, and then you want to plug in
the third quarter just right there.

361
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,400
Lastly, we can install the interactive

362
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,600
cover to do that, we're going
to first install our button.

363
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,240
So here's our button we want to do is you

364
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,480
want to unscrew and get
the nut after that.

365
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,440
And the next we want to do is make sure

366
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,640
it's facing upwards
with the Fangoria on the right hand side.

367
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,280
The screen on the left hand side

368
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,120
that you want to do is just simply.

369
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,720
Scoop Arcangel not.

370
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,200
Right, that and this will
hold the buttons stable.

371
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,760
Make sure you align
the button so it looks nice.

372
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,800
Just like that,

373
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:55,720
next, we're going to install the screen,
so to install the screen.

374
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,320
Simply

375
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,400
put, four Nilus screws and then
tie them up with a nylon, that's.

376
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,880
Next, we're going to connect

377
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,680
to the display table,
this might be a little bit tricky if you

378
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,360
get a cable like I do,
where it's only two black cables and one

379
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,840
yellow and one red cables,
if that's the case,

380
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:25,240
the black cable next to the red cable,
that should be your ground and the other

381
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,040
black cable next to the yellow
cable, that's your state.

382
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,000
So there are actual labels on the

383
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,560
screen itself, as well as
labels on the driver hat.

384
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,040
Just make sure these each wire goes

385
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,640
to where they intend to go and they are
properly aligned next to, well,

386
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,200
plugging the button and
displaying cable for the button.

387
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,640
There is a port on the board.

388
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,000
That's a stop button.

389
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,520
So you just connect it right there.

390
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,760
And then as for the display cable,
you connect it right there

391
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,560
and then what you do is you carefully

392
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,600
wrapped it up,

393
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,800
then attached to it
to complete the install,

394
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,520
put your top play along in these
four corners and the two standoffs.

395
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,800
And I simply use two nylon screws

396
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,200
and screw adding.

397
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,840
For the front to stand off

398
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:38,400
to other nylon, screw nylon nuts, sorry,
and then simply tighten it off.

399
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,320
Lastly, plugging in your power cable,

400
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,760
the split off power cable
show in the first port.

401
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,200
Plugging the other USB cable
from the power bank to the fourth port

402
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,720
on a controller
and plugging the USB charging port

403
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:03,360
on the power bank into the port,
that's next to the splatting USB port.

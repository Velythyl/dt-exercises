    "We have explored different image processing algorithms as a means of enhancing certain aspects of an image (e.g., edges), while diminishing the presence of others (e.g., noise, irrelevant texture, etc.). We have implemented some of these tools to perform a Braitenberg-like approach to visual servoing, whereby we use weightings over edge detections to control the Duckiebot's steering in an effort to keep it in its lane as it drives forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previous approach was *state-less*---it reacted to the robot's image, but had no (explicit) representation of the state of the robot or the environment. Rather than design a controller that reasons over the raw image, we will process the image to estimate the robot's orientation (heading) relative to the lane. We can then combine this estimate for the robot's lane-relative heading with the PID controller that we developed earlier to in an effort to keep the robot in its lane.\n",

    "In the following, we will investigate one approach to estimating the robot's lane-relative orientation from images. Similar to the previous exercise, this approach makes use of the dashed-yellow and solid-white lane markings as valuable cues for determining the robot's orientation relative to the lane. The key is to isolate these lane markings from the rest of the image and then approximate them as a set of line segments. We can then transform these line segments into the ground reference frame and then determine the best-fit to their orientations relative to the robot. We can then estimate the orientation of the robot relative to the lane."

    "Lane markings appear as locations in the image marked by rapid changes in intensity. We have explored different approaches to isolating these *edges* based on intensity gradients, most recently using the Sobel Operator. A popular approach to detecting edges is the *Canny edge detector*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like other edge detectors, the Canny edge detector looks for regions of the image with strong intensity gradients. The algorithm then refines these detections via non-maxima supression (a variant of which we used for the Sobel Operator-based edge detection). While non-maxima suppression is often effective at removing edges that result from noise, it can also get rid of valid edges. Thus, the Canny edge detector employs a form of hysteresis, whereby it preserves \"weak\" edges that are connected to \"strong\" edges. Here, the idea is that valid edges that may appear as weak will be connected to strong edges, whereas those that occur as a result of noise will not be connected to strong edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, the Canny edge detector divides edges into three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Those whose gradient magnitude is sufficiently large that they are identified as valid edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Those whose gradient magnitude is sufficiently low that they are identified as erroneous edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Those whose gradient magnitude is inconclusive and are evaluated in terms of hysteresis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Canny edge detector differentiates between the three using two thresholds, a `canny_lower_threshold` below which edges are labeled as being erroneous, a `canny_upper_threshold` above which edges are labeled as being valid. Intensity gradients between the two thresholds are further evaluated in terms of hysteresis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be discussing Canny edge detection in more detail later in the course, but if you are interested in more information on how the algorithm works, please see the [Canny edge detector Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector).\n",

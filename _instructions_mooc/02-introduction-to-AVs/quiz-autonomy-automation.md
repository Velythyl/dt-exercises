( ) automated
(x) autonomous
( ) neither

[explanation]
If what we call "R2-D2" contains Michael inside, and Michael is autonomous, then "R2-D2" is autonomous as well.

[x] An X-Wing
[x] The Death Star

[explanation]
 

>> Finally: which one is better, Star Wars or Star Trek? <<

(x) Star Wars 
( ) Star Trek

[explanation]
"Star Wars" is the right answer in this unit because it was designed by Andrea. Expect the answer to flip to "Star Trek" when we get to the "Control" module because Jacopo is teaching it.

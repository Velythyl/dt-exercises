_If you don't have a Duckiebot kit, skip this step_. You are missing a lot of the fun, but you can enjoy the course regardless.


## Duckietown assembly and setup  

Duckiebots like driving in Duckietowns!

The Duckietown cities are standardized and modular urban environments.

- üìêThey are standardized because of well-defined appearance specifications that detail the geometries and the colors of the road and signal layers. These specifications reduce the complexity of the environment in which the Duckiebots operate, providing a degree of control over the "nuisances" of the real world that affect the autonomous behaviors of a self-driving car.

- üß© They are modular because only five road segments are defined: straight, curve, 3-way intersection, 4-way intersection and empty tile. These components, which are built with interlockable "tiles", can be exchanged to produce an arbitrary number of city topologies. For the purpose of this course, we have fixed the size and complexity of the map to provide an introductory level challenge.

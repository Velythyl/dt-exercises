_If you don't have a Duckiebot, skip this step_. You are missing a lot of the fun, but you can enjoy the course regardless.

# ðŸš™ Duckiebot user interface and operation

Now that we have a Duckiebot on the network it is time to learn how interact with it.

In addition to the Duckietown Shell, which is a terminal based interface, the Duckiebot is equipped with a browser based interface too: the "Dashboard".

The Dashboard allows to interact with live camera stream, software running on the robot, real time diagnostics and more in an intuitive way.  

## Step 1. Setup the Dashboard   

You can follow [these][book-dashboard-setup-tutorial] instructions to set up the Dashboard.

## Step 2. Use the Dashboard     

After successfully logging in, you can follow [this][book-dashboard-use-tutorial] tutorial providing an overview of the functionalities included in the Dashboard.

After this step you should be able to orient yourself through the Duckiebot graphical user interface and access stored files, running containers, hardware diagnostics and camera data stream.

Take some time to explore your Duckiebot's different functionalities. What are the containers running? What messages are being passed around?    

ðŸ¤” If you have problems with these first two steps, please ask [a question on our Stack Overflow with tag `#dashboard`](https://stackoverflow.com/c/duckietown/questions/tagged/dashboard).

## Step 3. Make the Duckiebot move

We are ready to have the Duckiebot move! Remotely control your Duckiebot by following [these instructions][book-db-move].

## Step 4. See what the Duckiebot sees

We used Dashboard to view the camera image stream, but to see what the Duckiebot sees, we need a different approach. Follow [these][book-db-see] instructions to view the camera data from terminal.

## Step 5. Checkpoint!

At the end of this module you are able to drive your Duckiebot around the house while comfortably sitting at your computer. You are able to see what the robot sees through browser or terminal.

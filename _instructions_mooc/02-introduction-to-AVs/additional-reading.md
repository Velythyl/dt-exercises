> Marco Pavone, [*Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems for Future Urban Mobility*][link]

> Abstract: This chapter discusses the operational and economic aspects of autonomous mobility-ondemand (AMoD) systems, a transformative and rapidly developing mode of transportation wherein robotic, self-driving vehicles transport passengers in a given environment. Specifically, AMoD systems are addressed along three dimensions: (1) modeling, that is analytical models capturing salient dynamic and stochastic features of customer demand, (2) control, that is coordination algorithms for the vehicles aimed at throughput maximization, and (3) economic, that is fleet sizing and financial analyses for case studies of New York City and Singapore. Collectively, the models and methods presented in this chapter enable a rigorous assessment of the value of AMoD systems.

> Bryant Walker Smith, [*How Reporters Can Evaluate Automated Driving Announcements*][bryant] 

> Abstract: This article identifies a series of specific questions that reporters can ask about claims made by developers of automated motor vehicles (“AVs”). Its immediate intent is to facilitate more critical, credible, and ultimately constructive reporting on progress toward automated driving. In turn, reporting of this kind advances three additional goals. First, it encourages AV developers to qualify and support their public claims. Second, it appropriately manages public expectations about these vehicles. Third, it fosters more technical accuracy and technological circumspection in legal and policy scholarship.

# Learning more about Docker

Docker is the technology we use to package the software in Duckietown.

Most of the Docker magic is hidden to you by the Duckietown Shell (DTS) and **it will not be necessary to know more to pass this course**.

However, if you want to become a Duckietown hacker, it is useful to learn about Docker. Or, maybe finish the course first, and then come back for more details.

We have prepared for you [a short video (external video on Vimeo)][vimeo-docker].

# ðŸ¥· Still want to know more details?

All right, do you want to know even more? We then would like to point you at [this more detailed introduction of the "under-the-hood" technology at Duckietown][link-RH].

Note: the path of the Duckietown hacker is a solitary path; while the MOOC is taking place, we cannot answer questions on these advanced topics. If you are really interested in going deeper, then maybe you can find a link to our Slack, and from there find the development channels...

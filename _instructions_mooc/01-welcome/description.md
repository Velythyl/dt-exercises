This MOOC contains many different types of content.

We use the following emoji to help navigate the EdX interface.

- 📹 for video lectures to watch;
- 🤔 for quizzes;
- 💡 for "thinking activities", including extra reading;
- 💻 for code activities or other activities in front of a screen;
- 💬 for discussions;
- ❓ for surveys.

All robot activities are marked with 🚙: if you don't have a robot, skip these. (You are missing out a lot of the fun!)

Finally, the Duckietown Ninja 🥷 marks **optional, in-depth content** that is not necessary to pass the course.

<!--
The ninja marks the content for those who want to go deeper into the Duckietown rabbit hole. For most people, it's perhaps a good idea to do first the regular MOOC, and then follow the ninja.

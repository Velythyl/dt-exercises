# Ready to get started?

Your first task is to set up your development environment.

We have made every effort to keep the number of accounts and requirements to an absolute minimum, a serious challenge in robotics!

This document summarizes the steps that you need to do. We will write here on edX _a  synthetic summary_ for the steps to take. Usually the details are in one of our Duckiebooks at the site [docs.duckietown.org/daffy/](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/).


Change history:

- March 24, 2021:
  
    - We clarified the Checkpoint step related to `docker login`.  
    - Removed mention of duckietown.org profile link because it might take some time to appear.



## Step 1: Make all the accounts first!

At some point, in the next steps, you will need the following accounts:

* **Github account**. Needed for checking out the code. Sign up [here][signup-github].

* **Dockerhub account**. Needed for submitting exercises. Sign up [here][signup-dockerhub].

* **Duckietown account**. Needed to gain access to the autograder and many other features. Sign up [here][signup-duckietown].

* **Stack Overflow account**. Needed to gain access to [our private Stack Overflow][stack-overflow-duckietown].  **You will receive an invite after you sign up for a Duckietown account**.


## Step 2: Laptop setup

Follow [these instructions][duckiebook-laptop-setup].

At the end of the instructions, you will have installed some essential software, such as

* Docker

* The Duckietown Shell

ðŸ¤” If you have problems with this step, please ask [a question on our Stack Overflow with tag #laptop-setup](https://stackoverflow.com/c/duckietown/questions/tagged/laptop-setup).

## Step 3: Duckietown account link

Make sure you finish the previous step before continuing!

Follow [these instructions] [duckiebook-account-setup] to set up your local environment with the Duckietown token.

## Step 5: Checkpoint!

Before we go on, this is a checkpoint to make sure you have installed everything.

If some of these commands don't work, please go back and fix it before continuing.

If the Docker installation went well, then you can run the following command:

    > docker run hello-world
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

If you set up a Github account and private key, you should be able to run this command successfully:

    > ssh -T git@github.com
    Hi GITHUB_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

If you have a valid DockerHub account then you can login as follows.

    > docker login -u DOCKER_USERNAME
    Password:
 

If the Duckietown Shell was installed, then you can run a command like this:

    > dts version

If you correctly configured the token, then this command should work:

    > dts challenges info
    ~        You are successfully authenticated:
    ~
    ~                     ID: YOUR ID
    ~                   name: YOUR NAME
    ~                  login: YOUR DUCKIETOWN ACCOUNT 
    ~
    ~         You can find the list of your submissions at the page:
    ~
    ~              https://challenges.duckietown.org/v4/humans/users/YOUR ID


If there is something not working, please stop here. Ask for help on Stack Overflow.

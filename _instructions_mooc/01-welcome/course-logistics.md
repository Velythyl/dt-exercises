# Course Logistics

Here is some organizational information about the course. You can some of this information in the course Syllabus in the "Handouts" section of the "Course" page.

## Welcome

Welcome, again, to Self-Driving Cars with Duckietown!

This course is the result of the collaboration of ETH Zurich (ETHZ), the University of Montreal (UdM), the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC) and Duckietown.

The Duckietown platform was created in 2016 to teach the science and technology of autonomous vehicles to the master students of MIT. You can learn more about the history of the Duckietown project [here](duckietown-history).

## The Staff

Throughout the course you will meet instructors from all the organizing institutions. In order of appearance:

* Andrea Censi, Ph. D., ETHZ
* Jacopo Tani, Ph. D., ETHZ
* Matthew Walther, Prof., TTIC
* Liam Paull, Prof., UdM
* Andrea Daniele, TTIC

Before the corse starts, we wanted to take a few minutes to introduce ourselves. You can watch this informal video on Vimeo: [Informal staff introductions][video-staff-intro].

Each of us will lead one or more learning modules. The lead-instructor will always be the go-to person for addressing questions.

Additionally, Andrea Daniele will be responsible of supporting software challenges, and Jacopo hardware related ones. You can learn how to get help [here][sec:how-to-help]

## Intended Learning Outcomes

This course is designed to be hands-on. This means that you will actually have to _do_ things in the real world with the information we will provide you. In the context of robotics, "real" world could mean a simulated environment as well as the physical world.   

By the end of this course, we will learn about the fundamental of robotics. What qualifies as a robot? What do they have in common? What are the differences and implications of logical and physical autonomy architectures? How painful is the difference between what _should_ happen in theory and what _actually_ happens, and how do we go from understanding to implementation?

Self-driving Cars with Duckietown is a "grand tour" of robotics. The focus is on the breadth rather than the depth. We  highlight how robotics is a system level discipline where many components interact with each other to produce real world autonomous behaviors. Any of these "components" could absorb an entire professional career.

Finally, we want to provide an understanding of the difference in approaches to solving the challenges of autonomy. The buzz of AI is high, but what's it place in robotics? How does using reinforcement or imitation learning relate to the "traditional" robotics approaches to given tasks?

Robotics and AI are a fast-paced field of research. This course is the beginning of a learning adventure.

<!--
Your first task is to set up your development environment.

Compared to other courses you might have taken, it might seem intimidating to set up so many things at the beginning.
However, it's going to be worth it, we promise!

This document summarizes the steps that you need to do. We will write here on EdX _a  synthetic summary_ for the steps to take. Usually the details are in one of our Duckiebooks at the site [docs.duckietown.org/daffy/](https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/).

## Step 0: Watch a short introduction to the development workflow

If you want to know more about the big picture and why we ask you to do all these setup steps, please watch this video on Vimeo:

* [Development workflow (Andrea)][video-devel] **TODO**

## Step 1: Make all the accounts first!

At some point, in the next steps, you will need the following accounts:

* **Github account**. Needed for checking out the code. Sign up [here][signup-github].

* **Dockerhub account**. Needed for submitting exercises. Sign up [here][signup-dockerhub].

* **Duckietown account**. Needed to gain access to the autograder and many other features. Sign up [here][signup-duckietown].

* **Stack Overflow account**. Needed to gain access to [our private Stack Overflow][stack-overflow-duckietown].  **You will receive an invite after you sign up for a Duckietown account**.


## Step 2: Laptop setup

Follow the instructions [here][duckiebook-laptop-setup].

At the end of the instructions, you will have installed some essential software, such as

* Docker

* The Duckietown Shell

🤔 If you have problems with this step, please ask [a question on our Stack Overflow with tag #laptop-setup](https://stackoverflow.com/c/duckietown/questions/tagged/laptop-setup).

[duckiebook-laptop-setup]: https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_duckiebot/out/laptop_setup.html

## Step 3: Duckietown account link

Make sure you finish the previous step before continuing!

Follow the instructions [here][duckiebook-account-setup] to set up your local environment with the Duckietown token.

[duckiebook-account-setup]: https://docs.duckietown.org/daffy/opmanual_duckiebot/out/dt_account.html


## Step 5: Checkpoint!

Before we go on, this is a checkpoint to make sure you have installed everything.

If some of these commands don't work, please go back and fix it, before continuing.

If Docker installation went well, then you can run the following command:

    > docker run hello-world
    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

If you set up Github account and private key, you should be able to run this command successfully:

	> ssh -T git@github.com
    Hi GITHUB_USERNAME! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

If you have a valid DockerHub account then you can run

	❯ docker login -u DOCKER_USERNAME
    Password:

The second time it will just tell you:

    Authenticating with existing credentials...
    Login Succeeded

If the Duckietown Shell was installed, then you can run a command like this:

    > dts version

If you correctly configured the token, then this command should work:

	> dts challenges info
    ~        You are succesfully authenticated:
    ~
    ~                     ID: 3
    ~                   name: YOUR NAME
    ~                  login: YOUR DUCKIETOWN ACCOUNT


If there is something not working, please stop here. Ask for help on Stack Overflow.

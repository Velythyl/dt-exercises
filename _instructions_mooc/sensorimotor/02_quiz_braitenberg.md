>> What are sensorimotor architectures? <<

( ) The art of placing sensors and actuators in an efficient way on the robot.
(x) Agents with direct connections between sensor(s) and actuator(s), without intermediate representations.
( ) Fundamental guidelines for achieving machine autonomy. 
( ) An academic exercise to prove that complex solutions (i.e., solutions made of multiple components interacting with each other) are undesirable.

[explanation]
Before running we must learn how to walk. Autonomy is not magic and interesting scenarios can be obtained with simple algorithms. 
[explanation]

>> What are Braitenberg vehicles? <<

(x) Attempts to model the behaviors of the animal world on robots in a minimalistic way. 
(x) Robots whose agents are simple sensorimotor architectures between the sensor(s) and actuator(s).
( ) The first-ever autonomous robots.
( ) Childish attempts at quantifying emotions.

[explanation]
The Braitenberg vehicle executes simple reactive behaviors. The behavior is of the vehicle is directly controlled by the sensors without any intermediate logic. 
[explanation]

>> Why are Braitenberg vehicles important? <<

( ) They are not.
( ) Because they demonstrate that complex software architectures are useless to achieve autonomy.
(x) Because they demonstrate the rise of complex behaviors with extremely simple algorithms.
( ) Because they allow us to understand animal behavior, by recreating it.

[explanation]
The key takeaway from BVs is that complex behaviors don't require complex math or coding.
[explanation]

>> Do you find Braitenberg vehicles fascinating? <<

(x) Yes
(x) No
(x) I don't have an opinion on this.

[explanation]
We do. It's the easiest way to bring a robot to "life". Very small tweaks to the connections can generate complex behaviors that may even appear "intelligent"!

    "A controller outputs commands that can be executed by our robot to achieve a certain goal. For example, in the case of the Duckiebot, the control signals are the linear velocity $v$ and angular velocity $\\omega$ of the robot. \n",
    "\n",
    "The **P**roportional-**I**ntegral-**D**erivative (PID) controller is an example of a feedback controller where we use an output ($y_t$) of the system to measure tracking errors ($e_t$), that evolve in time, from some reference signal ($r_t$) to alter the control signals ($u_t$), so that the errors are driven to lower values (ideally zero) in time.\n",

    "Consider a Duckiebot driving in the middle of a road with a constant linear velocity. Let's say our goal is to make sure the robot stays in the middle of the lane by adjusting its angular velocity. Intuitively, whenever the robot deviates from the middle of the lane, we will adjust the angular velocity so the robot turns toward the middle of the lane. The question is: by how much?\n",
    "\n",
    "The name proportional-integral-derivative comes from the fact that the controller adjusts the control signals proportionally to the error at every time instant, while also considers the integral of the error over time (i.e., the accumulation, or sum, of error over time), and the derivative of the error at each time step (i.e., the rate of change of the error over time). The control command is calculated by considering the combination of these three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_t = k_p e(t) + k_i \\int_0^t e(\\tau) d \\tau + k_d \\frac{d e_t}{dt},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_p$, $k_i$, and $k_d$ denote the proportional, integral, and derivative coefficients of the controller, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "The PID control problem is to determine values for these parameters (e.g., via trial and error) until the closed loop system performs reasonably well. Typically (but it depends strongly on the complexity of the system):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increasing $k_p$ will decrease the the time it takes for the system to approach the reference point (i.e., rise time), but at the risk of overshooting. \n",
    "- Increasing $k_d$ will help to decrease this overshooting by preventing the robot from moving too quickly in a direction that increases the error. \n",
    "- Increasing $k_i$ will help us to eliminate the steady-state error (i.e., the remaining error that we have when the system has converged), and compensate for unexpected external stimuli during operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can start by only adjusting $k_p$ while keeping $k_i=0$ and $k_d=0$ until the controller is somewhat able to reach the target. We can then fix $k_p$ at this value, and start adjusting $k_d$. Once we found a good value of $k_d$, that reduces the oscillations without slowing the system response down too much, we can proceed to adjust $k_i$ as needed to mitigate steady state errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the above approach to tune our PID controller may work in practice, there is **no guarantee** that our robot will be stable (e.g., it may oscillate around or even completely diverge from the reference point). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches for designing PID controllers in a formal way and obtaining those guarantees. Talking about them though would require introducing more advanced system modeling methods (e.g., linearization, linear time-invariant systems, state-space representations, transfer functions), as well as analysis methods for dynamic systems (e.g., Bode diagrams, Nyquist plots, root locus) and synthesis techniques (e.g., loop shaping, pole placement), for actually determining the coefficients. There is a vast literature on PID control, and new variations on the theme are published every year although it is already a very established method. A video introduction to control systems can be found online, e.g., in the [Control Systems I](https://video.ethz.ch/lectures/d-mavt/2018/autumn/151-0591-00L/6a74fd84-5047-4639-b640-3ab2e6937e8a.html) course held at ETH Zurich.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The popularity of PID control is due to the fact, amongst other factors, that these formal methods are not necessary to reach a satisfactory outcome. \"Rule of thumb\" methods such as the Ziegler-Nichols can help us to tune our PID controller, but trail and error (or, \"synthesis by iterations\", a. k. a. \"tweak until death\") works, too!\n",

    "## Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we will design a proportional, integrative, derivative (PID) controller to regulate the heading ($\\theta_t$) of a Duckiebot, while it is driving at a constant linear speed ($v_0$). \n",
    "\n",
    "In reference to the PID control diagram above, we consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $r_t = \\theta_{ref,t} = \\theta_{ref}$: the reference signal is a constant angle, expressed in radians\n",
    "* $\\hat y_t = \\hat \\theta_t$: the controlled variable is the heading of the Duckiebot. This controller controller will estimate it's heading based on the odometry model deigned in the [odometry activity](../05-Odometry/odometry_activity.ipynb), so make sure you're happy about that before proceeding! \n",
    "* $u_t = [v_0, \\, \\omega]^T$: the output of the controller, and input to the plant, will be two variables. The first will be the linear speed of the robot, which we will assume constant throughout this activity. The variable we will control is the angular rate ($\\omega_t = \\dot \\theta_t = \\frac{d \\theta_t}{dt})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this activity is to determine the values of $k_p, k_i, k_d$ such that we obtain \"good\" tracking performances."

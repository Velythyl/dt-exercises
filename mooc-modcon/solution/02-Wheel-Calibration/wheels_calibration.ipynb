    "<img src=\"../images/wheel-calibration/model.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 500px;\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "To obtain it, we introduced simplifying assumptions: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The robot is symmetric along the the longitudinal axis;\n",
    "2. The wheels do not slip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, neither of these two assumptions really holds in practice. As a result: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The robot will not drive straight when receiving equal commands to the wheels;\n",
    "2. The wheels (might) slip. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity we will calibrate the wheels to mitigate these undesired effects."

    "## Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the relationship we derived between the voltage provided to each motors and the resulting angular velocity of the wheel:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_t = \\left( R\\frac{b}{K_i} + K_b \\right) \\dot \\phi_t $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficient is a function of the wheel radius and the motor constants, which are difficult to estimate. We therefore lump all terms in a single unknown motor coefficient ($m$). Writing the same for right and left wheels, we get two motor coefficients to estimate: $m_l$ and $m_r$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To provide some physical insight, we reparametrize these two unknowns in two physically meaningful quantities, the _gain_ ($g$) and _trim_ ($t$), so that the relation can be thought as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V_{r,t} = \\left( g + t \\right) \\dot \\phi_{r,t} $$\n",
    "$$ V_{l,t} = \\left( g - t \\right) \\dot \\phi_{l,t} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way we always have two parameters to find, but we know that increasing (decreasing) the gain will make the robot go faster (slower), while adjusting the trim value will correct asymmetries in the driving. "

    "\n",
    "The gain parameter can have any value betwen 0 and 1. The default is set as 1. \n",

    "The objective of this first section is to determine a value of the gain that works well for your Duckiebot. There isn't a right or wrong number, the best value will vary depending on the desired driving experience. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Make sure your Duckiebot is powered on and connected to the network. You can verify this by accessing the Dashboard > Robot page and visualizing live statistics, and / or by pinging the Duckiebot from your computer. \n",

    "5. Connect to VNC and open the virtual joystick and a terminal by double-clicking on the respective desktop icons, \n",
    "   \n",
    "6. The default value of the gain is set at 1. You can verify this yourself by either typing:\n",
    "\n",
    "       rosparam get /ROBOTNAME/kinematics_node/gain\n",
    "\n",
    "in the terminal (and pressing ENTER), or by navigating to your Dashboard > File Manager > Calibrations > Kinematics and opening the file `default.yaml`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Select the virtual joystick you previously opened in VNC, and drive your robot on the Duckietown. Bring it on a tour, try all movements (forward, back, left and right turns). Notice if the wheels are slipping. You can set a new value for the gain with:\n",
    "\n",
    "       rosparam set /ROBOTNAME/kinematics_node/gain gain-value\n",
    "\n",
    "where `gain-value` is a number bewteen 0 and 1. The lower the number, the slower the robot will go and wheels will slip less.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Re-click on the joypad, and bring your Duckiebot on another tour. You shold observe a different behavior consistent with the new gain value.\n",
    "\n",

    "       rosparam get /ROBOTNAME/kinematics_node/trim\n",
    "       \n",
    "4. Select the virtual joystick (arrow-pad) in VNC and drive straight (press only ⬆️) for roughly 2 meters (3 tiles)\n",

    "\n",

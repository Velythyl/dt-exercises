## Exercise: lateral position control 

# v_0 = u[0]
# rosparam set /!hostname/kinematics_node/gain v_0


# for the exercise: no longer heading control, but y direction control

# challenge used to evaluate is LF
# world is a straight lane (or whatever)
# initial condition of the robot is in the opposite lane
# (we are playing now with (d, theta))
# d0 = -2 (whatever brings you in the opposite lane)
# theta0 = whatever = 0
# d_ref = 0 # (this means be at the center of the lane, as in regular lane following)
# e = d_ref - dhat
# (dhat is initialized with d0)
# dhat = dlast + delta_d
# theta = R/(2*L)*(delta_phi_right-delta_phi_left)
# delta_d = R/2*(delta_phi_l + delta_phi_r)*cos(theta) #(double check cos)
# v = gain = 0.5 (whatever)
# omega = PID(e)
# u = [v omega]



# To get the exrecise done, what do students need to know? 
# ACTIVITY 1. Assume that if v_l = v_r, the robot goes straight. Why? because this is what the model we are using tells us. 
# In reality, this is not the case -> wheel calibration, i.e., find trim so that the robot goes kind of straight

# ACTIVITY 2. We need R, L --> odometry calibration --> Nice to have least square approach, but manual measurement works fine as well

# ACTIVITY 3. Deadreckoning model --> odometry-activity 

# ACTIVITY 4. Understand how PID works.. --> heading control

# Exercise: use all the above together to do lateral position control.
